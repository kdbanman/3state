- implement waveform generator based upon InformationSpectrum parameters and framerate.

- put a square root envelope over the the visual intensity map to improve the visibility like the translucent green rectangle did.

- overlay information frequency distribution as dynamic curve at bottom right
	- draggable left and right boundary bars for use with sound interface

- save/load
	- either use selectFolder() function or write my own bitchin' interface (the latter would be good so that navigating the saved rules looks sweet/informative)
	- should save with current seed for looping.  user can random/unity if he wants.

- undoable rule changes
	- it would be good if this were somehow informative, because just seeing the rule menu change won't be very good.  perhaps the change marker system that's coming
	- maybe some kind of visible stack?

- add rule outliner to scope

- render change markers in middle bar
	- render rule change markers in middle bar
	- render reseed markers in middle bar

- minimal boundary-less tiles like logan's projecty desnignenigfey thing.  also that thing duncan said with the 3d.
	- optional mode

IMPORTANT COMPLETED NOTES
=========================

- use only contiguous spectrum for sound production.  faster with cleaner information. purge the other spectrum 
	- non contiguous is prettier to look at, but it'll be much fuglier and smeared out to listen to.  it's also really fucking slow.  multithreading actually slowed me down, but oh well.  i'm working with integers and arrays, after all.  that shit's fast.
